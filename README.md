Hello, I'm a high school student who likes to learn coding and hope to one day be able
to be a respected computer scientist when I'm older. I am really interested into space 
and the world around me. I have a dog named, Shadow who has to listento me read all the 
lines of my code whenever I have to debug it. He's a good sport
about it.
